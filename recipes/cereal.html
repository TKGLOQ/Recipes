<h2>Cereal, a good snack sometimes</h2>
<p>Choco pillows is a good cereal sometimes.
    I say sometimes because it is often a bit too high 
    in sugar, meaning perhaps 15-25g of sugar per 100g.
     My daily sugar intake may be 40g, but more ideally
     it would be around 30g.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>To create a bowl of cereal, you simply need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>A bowl</li>
    <li>Choco pillow cereals</li>

</ul>
<p>After you have gathered these items, you simply:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pour the cereal into the bowl</li>
    <li>Pour the milk into the bowl</li>
</ol>
<p>And <em>voila</em>, you now have a good bowl of cereal.</p>
